## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla js
- Responsive web design

### What I learned
i have been learning javascript. I learned a lot from this practice exceptionally how to validate numbers or text in the input field, also how can we change textContent based on live input values. however, in the future i think will be able to manipulate on the html elements more than now.
